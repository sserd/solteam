            <p style="font-size:x-large;">An interesting group of people from a broad academic background who have come
                together for once to have
                fun working on
                Helio-Physics. While a research work isn't just another easy task to carry out, it is for the same
                reason that having a
                joyous time doing it is as important. Well, this is a team of eleven and though it brought with it a
                bunch of technical
                skills, it brought with it a bunch of ideas to relax and have fun too, which turned out to be one
                significant part of
                the internship part from the most important one - the research work itself. Ultimately, the team
                together succeeded in
                getting the work done, predicting efficiently the occurrence of solar flares using Machine Leaning.</p>
